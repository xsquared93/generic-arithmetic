# generic-arithmetic
a generic arithmetic system implemented using one of SiCP lessons, namely data directed programming.

## tasks left to do - so if you want to contribute just add a package.
- [x] implement a `radical` package;
- [x] implement a `matrix` package;
- [x] implement a `fraction` package;
- [x] implement a `polynomial` package;
- [ ] implement a `rational-function` package;
- [x] implement an `integer` package;
- [ ] implement a generic `print` procedure;
- [x] define the procedures in the `polynomial` package to operate on abstract data, ie., data abstraction; and
- [ ] define the procedures in the `matrix` package to operate on abstract data, ie., data abstraction.

## Built with:

- Emacs and MIT Scheme.

## Why `data-directed programming`?

Data directed programming is a technique for increasing modularity of your system; by dividing the system into packages multiple individuals can work on the system at the same time.

## How to run the software?

### macOS

First, you have to to install `Emacs` and `MIT Scheme`; if you haven't already, you can install these using `homebrew`, the package manager for macOS.
Then, you load the file `generic-arithmetic.scm`. 

You can look at the tests to get an idea of how data is represented and  to try out more examples.

## Thanks!
